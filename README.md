Demo project to create/test CLIs written using TypeScript

It is surprisingly difficult to find a currently-working example of how
to create and test Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) written in TypeScript.

This project updates the
[How to Create a Testable CLI using TypeScript?](https://www.realpythonproject.com/how-to-create-a-testable-cli-using-typescript/)
from Jan 2023 with various fixes that were not obvious (at least to me).

These include:

*  Restricting to "chalk": "^4.1.2"
